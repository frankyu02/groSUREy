- Continuing to work on tickets for front-end

Decisions

Next demo goal:

Frontend:
- A functioning app that has some pitfalls, but overall works
- Doesn't have to connect to the backend but code should be in place for that

Backend:
- Goal is to make sure front-end can send/receive the data
- Host on some domain
- At least one endpoint should be somewhat functional for both backend and frontend
